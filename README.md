# TBC React Project README

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure with the main files organized in the root "TBC-React" folder. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file for handling dynamic behavior on the web page.
- **README.md**: The Markdown file for instructions.
- **assets**: The folder for media files.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:
* HTML: Markup language for structuring the content of the web page.
* CSS: Stylesheet language for designing the layout and appearance.
* JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity and dynamic features to the web page (ES6 syntax).
This project is intentionally kept simple, utilizing only these core web technologies as it was one of the demands of the task.
Therefore I did not use any JavaScript or CSS library.
